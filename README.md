GeoTZ
=====

Tanzania regions in GeoJSON downloaded from GADM 2.0
http://gadm.org/country

and if necessary simplified to less than 10 megabytes using 
http://mapshaper.org/

TZA_adm2 geoJSON was reduced by 84% to make it fit under Github 10mb
display limit.

TopoJSON is a standard for line-drawing rather than shape-drawing. It is
roughly twice as compact so can have 100% detail but here it does not have regional names.
